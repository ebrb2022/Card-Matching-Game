# Card Matching Game
This is a simple browser-based card matching game that has been implemented to demonstrate my current knowledge of Javascript, HTML, and CSS for an Introduction to Web Development class that I'm taking. This game uses Unicode playing card symbols to display the card deck, plus features a move counter, a timer, a reset button, and an alert box which pops up with a message when the user matches all the pairs.
